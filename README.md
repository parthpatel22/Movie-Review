# Movie-Review
Classify movie reviews as positive or negative using a Naive Bayes Classifier
To test and run the program you would require a dataset.
I used the IMDB large movie review dataset while creating and running the file. You can download it from https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
The dataset would have two folders of train and test, and each folder would further have pos(positive) and neg(negative) folder. 
In the pos folder, you would have positive reviews and in the neg folder, you would have negative reviews.
After downloading it, update the Run_Me file by providing the location of your dataset in it.
After updating the Run_Me file, run the Run_Me file to train the Naive_Bayes classifier using the files in train folder. 
After training, the program would classify the files of test folders and provide accuracy of the Naive Bayes Classifier
